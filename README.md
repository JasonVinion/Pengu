## üñ• System Requirements

- **Python 3.6+** (auto-installs dependencies)
- **Administrator privileges** (optional, required for traceroute and some advanced features)
- **Internet connection** (for dependency installation and tool functionality)

## üì¶ Installation & Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JasonVinion/Pengu.git
cd Pengu

# Run Pengu (auto-installs dependencies)
python3 Source/pengu.py
```

### Features Overview
- **Automatic Dependency Management**: No manual package installation required
- **Admin Detection**: Shows warnings when admin privileges are needed
- **Hardware Optimization**: Automatic performance tuning based on system specs
- **Enhanced UI**: Color-coded output with clear status indicators

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Enhanced Ping
```
ping ‚Üí Select single/mass ping ‚Üí Enter target(s) ‚Üí Press Q to stop
```

### Port Scanning with Hardware Optimization
```
port ‚Üí Enter IP ‚Üí Set port range ‚Üí Use recommended thread count
```

### Proxy Checking
```
proxy ‚Üí Specify proxy file ‚Üí Set thread count ‚Üí Save working proxies
```

### System Specs
```
specs ‚Üí View hardware info and performance recommendations
```

## ‚ö† Important Notes

### Administrator Privileges
- **Required for**: Traceroute (raw sockets), some hardware detection features
- **Optional for**: All other tools work without admin rights
- **Auto-detection**: Application shows clear warnings and elevation prompts

### Performance Recommendations
- **Thread Counts**: Based on CPU cores and system capabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Conservative defaults to avoid triggering server protections
- **Resource Usage**: Optimized for efficiency and stability

### Proxy Checker Details
- **Supported Formats**: 
  - `IP:PORT`
  - `TYPE://IP:PORT`
  - `IP:PORT:USER:PASS`
  - `TYPE://USER:PASS@IP:PORT`
- **Protocols**: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5
- **Features**: Anonymity detection, connection time measurement, filtering

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Subdomain Finder
- Custom thread counts with hardware recommendations
- Rate limiting warnings for high thread counts
- Progress tracking and real-time results

### Port Scanner
- Hardware-optimized thread recommendations
- Safety limits to prevent system overload
- Real-time open port discovery
